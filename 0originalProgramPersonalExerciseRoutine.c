// This is an original program for an exercise routine specifically tailored to me.
// The program is intended to be an andriod app and has timed rests in between sets
// and in between exercises.  The exercises are in groups targeting certain muscle groups 
// and will randomly rotate to give variety.  The user can press "START" to start the program,
// and "DONE" to indicate that they are "DONE" with the exercise and 
that the rest timer can turn on, and "END" to end the Exercise early.

// As an extension to the program, I will train a NN to recognise the command phrase "START", "DONE and "END".  
// As a further extension, the program will call out the exercises and motivational phrases.

#include<stdio.h>

void main() {
